# Drum Rig — Interactive Graphics Project

A 16-pad procedural drum machine and step sequencer with
stage lighting reactive to the audio spectrum and a beat-synced robot mascot.

**Live build:** [https://franzinluca.github.io/Final_project_computer_graphics/](https://sapienzainteractivegraphicscourse.github.io/final-project-lf_ig_final_project/)

Course: Interactive Graphics, Prof. Marco Schaerf — DIAG, Sapienza University of Rome.

## What it does

- **16-voice synthesis bank** across four selectable kits (Studio, Reggaetón,
  Techno, Drill), all generated procedurally with oscillator/noise synthesis —
  no audio samples.
- **Step sequencer** with a lookahead scheduler and quantized, multi-take
  recording; pad IDs stay stable across kit switches so a recorded pattern
  survives a kit change.
- **Hierarchical fold rig**: a closed slab unfolds into two wings via a
  hinge/fold solver driven entirely by scene-graph transforms, with staggered
  timing per wing rather than a single uniform tween.
- **Reactive lighting rig**: fixture intensity and color driven by an
  `AnalyserNode` FFT reading of the live mix, with asymmetric attack/release
  envelope following so lights punch on hits and decay smoothly.
- **Volumetric light shafts** via a raymarched post-process pass.
- **Procedural textures and materials only** — no imported image assets,
  so there are no licensing concerns anywhere in the scene.
- **Free orbit camera** plus scripted spherical-coordinate shot transitions
  for the power-on sequence.
- **Robot mascot** with beat-synced, code-driven arm animation (no imported
  keyframes/mocap).
- **Adaptive quality controller** that steps rendering resolution down under
  load, with backoff before stepping back up.

## Third-party components

Everything below is vendored into `/lib`; the project loads nothing from a
CDN and runs with no network connection.

| Component | Version | Licence | Used for |
|---|---|---|---|
| three.js | r185.1 | MIT | rendering, scene graph, materials |
| lil-gui | 0.21.0 | MIT | control panel |
| tween.js | 25.0.0 | MIT | eased animation of the unfold sequence and camera shots |

No third-party 3D models and no imported animations. All geometry, all
animation, and all texture maps are generated in project code at runtime.
